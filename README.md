# 360iDev-2016-PracticalSwiftGenerics

This repo contains code samples and a PDF version of the slides I used in my Practical Swift Generics talk given in Denver, CO on August 22, 2016 at the 360iDev conference.

## Version Information

I developed the code samples with Xcode 8 beta 6, and I'll be updating them if there are any breaking changes between beta 6 and the final release in a few weeks.

Pull requests with any suggestions on how to improve these samples are definitely welcome!
